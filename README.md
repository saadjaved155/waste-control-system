Waste Control System using Deep Learning in Smart City Context
Overview
This project focuses on waste classification using deep learning to improve waste management in smart cities. The system classifies waste into categories such as organic, inorganic, and specific materials like plastic, glass, metal, and paper.

Features:
1. Deep Learning-Based Classification: Uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify waste.
2. Multi-Class Categorization: Distinguishes between different types of waste.
3. FastAI & PyTorch Integration: Implements deep learning models efficiently.
4. Scalable & Adaptable: Can be extended with additional waste categories.

Technologies Used:
Python
PyTorch
FastAI
Torchvision
